# JeviLib
## A multifunction library for code modders, containing serialization utilities and tweening.
---

## What does it do?

This library holds a bunch of utilities I found necessary to create whilst I created [BW Chaos](https://boneworks.thunderstore.io/package/BWChaosDevs/BW_Chaos/), and that continues to remain useful on other projects. In these utilities are my `Prefs` system, numerous extension methods, and my serialization utilities (byte array lossless joiner and separator, `Vector3` byte converter).

Additionally, this contains an extensible tweener that code modders can use to smoothly transition the state of values from a starting value to another, with a position and scale tweener built in.
